[Thibaud Goiffon](https://thibaudgoiffon.fr) is a french student of graphic & interactive design, who's project, [Intimacy](https://thibaudgoiffon.fr/fr/interactives/intimacy/index.html) shows off an amazing spark of creativity, and ability to make curiously fun web toys!

Intimacy itself, is, in its creator's words: 

> A short poem, composed of images, sounds and texts.

It really delivers on that promise. Each sketch has its own unique feel, often combining unique reactive animations, surprising interactive components, and quirky sounds.

As a bonus (my favorite kind of bonus) Thibaud often uploads his creations to CodePen, where you can pry open the JavaScript tab and feast on the juicy code within.

Projects like this always hold a special place in my heart, creating an experience that hits on multiple senses at once & encourages you to play around with them as you try to learn how they work.

The code is really worth checking out, it's clever, clean and concise!
