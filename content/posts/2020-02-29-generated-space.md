This generated space, is a wonderful gallery of procedural and generative art, encompassing a wide variety of techniques and methods, created by the wonderful developer and artist [Kjetil Golid](https://twitter.com/kgolid).

In Kjetil's own words:

> It presents a wide range of different generative algorithms; from organic flow fields and particle systems to rigid fractals and grammar-based shapes. Some more serious than others.

The variety of generative art is really astounding, with creations taking inspiration from a wide diversity of origins and sources.

From artists such as [Jackson Pollock](https://generated.space/sketch/topollock/):

As well as amazing studies of isometric forms and shapes, creating wonderfully complex structures.

The Generated Space wouldn't be complete without a [shop](https://shop.generated.space/), where your work can be generated once, and printed textured paper. Making it your own perfectly unique piece.

Kjetil has generously  [open sourced](https://github.com/kgolid) a lot of his works, and has abstracted and exposed some of the useful pieces, such as the [palette collection](https://github.com/kgolid/chromotome) that keep the Generated Space popping with delight.
