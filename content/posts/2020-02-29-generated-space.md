The Generated Space is a gallery of procedural and generative art which encompasses a wide variety of techniques and methods. It was created by the wonderful developer and artist [Kjetil Golid](https://twitter.com/kgolid).

In Kjetil's own words:

> It presents a wide range of different generative algorithms; from organic flow fields and particle systems to rigid fractals and grammar-based shapes. Some more serious than others.

The variety of generative art is really astounding, with creations taking inspiration from a wide range of diverse origins and sources.

From artists such as [Jackson Pollock](https://generated.space/sketch/topollock/):

Exploring different generative algorithms and ideas, like [Cellular Automata](https://generated.space/sketch/hatch-automata-full/#143:122:10):

As well as amazing studies of isometric forms and shapes, creating wonderfully complex structures:

The Generated Space wouldn't be complete without a [shop](https://shop.generated.space/), where work can be generated once and printed on textured paper. You can buy your own perfectly unique piece of art.

Kjetil has generously made a lot of his works [open-source](https://github.com/kgolid), and has abstracted and exposed some of the useful pieces, such as the [palette collection](https://github.com/kgolid/chromotome) that keep the Generated Space popping with delightful color.
