Like emoji? Like to know what date it is? Like to be happy? Perhaps this calendar, [unicalendar](https://www.unicalendar.me/) is for you.

The unicalendar, a minimalistic and optimistic letterpressed calendar has everything you need to know, with a beautifully designed flair. 

Designer [John Williams](https://www.jw.design/) launched the design with a tweet in early December, which was probably the best time to buy it. The second best time is now.

Using emoji to mark specific days on a calendar is a beautiful idea, including markings for a lot of important dates as well, from Valentines day to dog appreciation day.

The calendar is 12 x 24 inches (thats 30.48 x 60.96 cm), and can be bought in a set of three (great gift!), and also with a frame... it looks like John uses the same dimensions each year, so if you find the calendar as fun as I do, you'll probably want to come back each year.

It looks like there are some beautiful emoji stickers packaged along with it too, just to seal the deal.

And, if you're still on the fence, remember, there were only 350 of these made, so it really will be that unique piece on the wall, really bringing the room together.
