As someone who has been writing code for a long time, I find that I really get stuck in my ways. Over time new editors roll around, new hardware, new everything.

[Uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) is a fantastic website by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/), providing an almanac of developers' websites, linking out to their respective `/uses` pages.

_What is a `/uses` page?_

A "uses" page, in this context, is, as the website describes: a page detailing developer setups, gear, software, and configs. Still confused? Here are a [few](https://wesbos.com/uses/) [great](https://kaleighscruggs.com/uses) [examples](https://ssmusoke.com/uses/).

Now, why is that useful? Well, if you're like me and have been stuck in your ways, its always going to be healthy to take a breath, and see how other people like to work. You just might learn something new!

[Uses.Tech](https://uses.tech/) has a few other fantastic features: You can filter by all sorts of categories! From the developers title, the type of work they do, the language they code in all the way down to the their country of origin.

This fantastic resource is also [open-source](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses/), so you can dig right in and see how its made (spoiler, its nice and modern and a great example of how to use gatsby for a static blog!)

And if you want to add yourself to the list, you can open up a pull request with your information added (there are plenty of great examples in there, if you're new to git!)

**Fun tidbit alert:** The site also features an animating favicon, which is a nice piece of added flair. You can see how that one is working in the [source](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses/blob/master/src/components/FavIcon.js) using a smart combination of emoji and the `canvas` [toDataUrl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toDataURL) function.
