Ever see a close button that uses the letter `x` rather than the glyph `×`?

[Glyphy](https://www.glyphy.io/) has you covered on this front. Whether it be the correct `×`, `★`, or the elusive `©` ... all the glyphs are just a click away!

The site is beautifully designed, the url is simple to remember, and it works super cleanly on your phone.

Glyphy was made by Australian design studio [Overlay](https://www.overlay.studio/) in a little down time. It's a perfect example of scratching your own itch... in their own words:

> It came out of a frustration of constantly needing to Google search things like "diagonal down arrow", "tick icon", etc.
