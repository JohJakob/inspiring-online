Game developer and student [Matt Stark](https://twitter.com/mattstark256) has come up with a simple idea that is expanding day by day into a really conceptually cool, mind-bending game.

The idea at its core is that each picture you take with your camera contains a world within it, taken right from the viewport of the photograph... you can then step right into that world!

In his own words, Mark dropped a brief summary on twitter of what's going down behind the scenes:

> When the player takes a photo I duplicate the environment, make it greyscale and slice the meshes to remove anything outside the photo. When they place it into the world I slice the environment's meshes to make a hole for the photo.

Over the past couple of months, Matt has been sharing more and more details, as the idea itself has been growing into more and more of a game.

Something super neat in this example is how the crates cut in half still have internal textures! For those who are familiar with 3d development, regularly the edges of the crate would each have their own texture, but nothing on the inside! When it's cut in half here, the volumetric shader makes sure the inside won't be completely empty!

These dibs and dabs of detail that really make a game feel captivating and enjoyable.

Conceptually, it's been wonderful to see the ideas expand and expand upon themself as Matt shares his experimentations on twitter.

Seeing this example of recursion really opens up the world this game is creating!

And this latest tweet, starting to show how you can use your magical camera to solve problems!

The game, now given the title Viewfinder, has a great future! It's well worth following Matt and keeping up with the progress!
