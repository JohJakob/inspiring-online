If you're the kind of person who likes beautiful graphs as well as keeping tight track of your life, this project is one for you.

[Year in pixels](https://year-in-pixels.glitch.me/) is a clever [Alejandro AR](https://kinduff.com/) app, with a minimalistic design that will allow you to track your mood throughout the year. 

For those now looking back at 2019, and thinking about 2020, [logging your daily mood](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/5-good-reasons-to-chart-your-mood-changes-1019155) a fantastic place to start. Not only allowing you to spot patterns in your life, but also letting you recognize earlier when you're starting to wear down.

And, if you've noticed in the url, the app is built on glitch! Which means you can [remix it](https://glitch.com/~year-in-pixels), changing the design, colors, or whatever you desire.

Alejandro has really gone above and beyond with this, allowing you to import and export your data, as well as take a look at the mood heatmap with some dummy data.

And thats not all, its also a progressive web app, so it'll keep working when you're offline. 

Even if you're not the introspective type, the code is very [neat and readable](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/year-in-pixels) and well worth the look over.
