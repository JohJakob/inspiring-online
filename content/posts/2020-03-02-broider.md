The aptly named [*broider*](https://maxbittker.github.io/broider/) by [Max Bittker](https://maxbittker.com/) is a nifty tool for creating, and ornamenting your borders.

Broider allows you to paint your borders in a one-bit style (that's either the bit is on or off, no colors), with a few small assists to help keep things in line: a 9x9 grid, an undo button (for people like me who never get things right the first time) and a little lock button that will keep all of your painting symmetrical.

The secret sauce behind broider's wonderful effect is utilizing CSS's [border-image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-image) property... honestly, not one that you see every day. The `border-image` property allows you to divide an image up into eight segments, one for each of the corners, and one for each of the edges (which will repeat). Its got a lot of options that can really make for a super unique style.

It's easy to be turned off by the idea of adding a `border-image`, trying to avoid adding another asset, broider takes care of that though, nesting your created image in `base64` format, so it can sit pretty in your CSS. Just copy and paste and you're good to go!

Here are a few of my favorite designs:

It's amazing to see how much variance can come from a few 9x9 bit boxes.

Some are recognizable as beloved borders of my past. This Pokemon one stands out especially.
