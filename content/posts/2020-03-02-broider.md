The aptly named [*Broider*](https://maxbittker.github.io/broider/) by [Max Bittker](https://maxbittker.com/) is a nifty tool for creating, and decorating, your borders.

Broider allows you to paint your borders in a one-bit style (the bit is either on or off, no colors), with a few small tools to help keep things in line: a 9x9 grid, an undo button (for people like me who never get things right the first time), and a little lock button that will keep all of your painting symmetrical.

The secret sauce behind Broider's wonderful effect is utilizing CSS's [`border-image`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-image) property... honestly, not something that you see every day. The `border-image` property allows you to divide an image up into eight segments, one for each of the corners, and one for each of the edges (which will repeat). It's got a lot of options that can make for a super unique style.

It's easy to be turned off by the idea of adding a `border-image` due to it needing an unwanted additional asset. However, Broider takes care of that by nesting your created image in `base64` format, so it can sit pretty in your CSS. Just copy and paste and you're good to go!


Here are a few of my favorite designs:

It's amazing to see how much variety can come from a few 9x9 bit boxes.

Some are recognizable as beloved borders of my past. This Pokemon one stands out especially.

Max, who's project, SandSpiel, was [previously covered]({{< ref "2020-01-18-sandspiel.md" >}}), has yet again made his work [open-source](https://github.com/MaxBittker/broider). It's well worth checking out if you want to learn a little TypeScript!
