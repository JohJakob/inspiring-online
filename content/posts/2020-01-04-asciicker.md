Ascii art and imagery have been around for a long time. This silky smooth demo really shows off how nice an ascii world rendered in real-time could look.

I mean, just look at the water, it's completely mesmerizing.

The amazing creator, [MrGumix](https://twitter.com/MrGumix) on Twitter, has a feed full of great videos and demos showing off some beautiful gameplay, as well as some great callouts to other Ascii based games.

You can play the demo, [Asciicker](http://asciicker.com/x13/) here. It's fairly simplistic gameplay wise, but at the same time shows off what can be a beautifully complex world. And for an added bonus, it runs fairly smoothly on your phone.

Having a quick peek behind the scenes revealed very little. A lot of incredibly low-level javascript, as far as a rendering engine is concerned, which would definitely explain the incredible performance.

MrGumix has said that he's currently working on another game. [Ascii Patrol](https://twitter.com/MrGumix/status/989555238209249280) (which itself looks great!) and afterwards, is planning to get back to Asciicker. He has even made a [Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/DzSuhHs) for people who want to follow along and voice their thoughts.
