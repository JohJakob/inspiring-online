_If only you could reset real-life dominoes with the click of a button_

This is probably the most fun you can have with dominoes without leaving your browser.

[CÃ©sar Botana](https://www.cesarbotana.com/)'s [Domino Party](https://malandrin.github.io/domino-party/#/) lets you fill up a 1x1 meter square with dominoes with a few nifty tools to make the job a little easier, like image templates and automatical triangles! You can then trigger your dominoes off and watch them fall, with the simulated WebGL physics leading the way!

Once you've made a creation you can save it (providing your dominoes trail hits the last domino in the screen) and then share it with the world. Here's [one of mine](https://malandrin.github.io/domino-party/#/view/46d7e506-0836-4916-a8a8-efef7c230039).

The main [domino party url](https://malandrin.github.io/domino-party/#/view) is rigged up in party mode, which strings all the domino sets together, in and a seemingly endless chain of creativity and domino based fun.
