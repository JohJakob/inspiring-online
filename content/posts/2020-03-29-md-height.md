[Mass Driver](https://mass-driver.com/) is the flashy new font foundry that just moved into the neighborhood.

They've just launched with a very creative pixel font, titled [MD-Eight](https://mass-driver.com/typefaces/md-eight), the eight namesake is because each character is set within an 8 by 8 grid of pixels.

The font makes great use of negative space, making it impressively legible for a font made out of pixels.

The real treat though is that along with the fonts [specimin sheet](https://mass-driver.fontdue.com/pdfs/bb5347171925852fbdcdf27b3783b831b8388580), there's a neat text-based adventure game to show it off!

[The Cave Of Dolmenlore](https://mass-driver.com/dolmenlore) is a great blast from the past, taking you right back to when text-based games ruled supreme and is truly one of the most creative ways I've seen a foundry show off their wares.

All of Mass Drivers fonts can be found on their [website](https://mass-driver.com/), they also offer trial fonts for download, so you can give them all a whirl.

As an extra tidbit, Mass Drivers website is built on a system called [FontDue](https://www.fontdue.com/), which has been made to get new foundries off the ground with as little work as possible, so people can really focus on the fonts!
