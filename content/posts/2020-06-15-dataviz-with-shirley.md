Truly, if you haven't run into [Shirleys' work before](https://sxywu.com/), you're in for a special treat. Each and every visualization has a truly unique design and generous speckling of interactivity allowing you to explore the data on your own, while also clearly getting the information across in a readable informative way (which is ironically rare in the online DataViz world).

Shirley also has a wealth of experience on the conference trail, and has a sharp ability to pinpoint exactly the kind of areas that people struggle with, or need to learn about!

Now, whether you're interested in getting into DataViz, or have done it for a long time, Shirleys new series, [Datavis with Shirliey](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/675872375) which has just started (on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/sxywu) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOvNTmUfo-s)) is the perfect opportunity for you to get in on the ground level and watch and learn as the process from start to finish.
