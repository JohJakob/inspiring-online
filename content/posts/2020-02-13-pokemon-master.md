At this point in our lives Pokémon is, and will always be, one of the best-selling and most popular games in existance... but everyone's attention fades with time. Still, a huge community of people continue to stick with the game and follow it through its many stages.

For me, I fell off in the last few years... BUT!

That doesn't make this amazing quiz, [Pokémon Master](https://weichiachang.github.io/pokemon-master/#/game), any less interesting and fun.

The idea is simple. If you've ever played the beloved **"WHO'S THAT POKÉMON"** game, well then you know all the rules. See the Pokémon. Guess the Pokémon. There's added complexity in that, although the Pokémon isn't shaded as a silhouette, it could literally be any Pokémon ever --- not just the easy to guess ones.

All of the code is generously [open source](https://github.com/WeiChiaChang/pokemon-master)!

It's a fantastic project to look at if you're interested in Vue as a framework. Honestly, this is a perfect example of how to make an application utilizing the many perks and strengths of Vue. If you're looking for a place to contribute, this codebase might very well be the one for you!

As another perk of the open-source nature of this code, there are many translations. If you haven't come across a time when you've had to implement multiple languages in your code yet, this is a great example to see how it's done and how to open up the code to get others involved.
