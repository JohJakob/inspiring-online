I know its there to catch the bugs, but nope, nope nope.

The self-proclaimed [buggiest site on the web](https://defaced.dev/web/the-buggiest-site-on-the-web/) really takes the cake with this scary console-based beast (use `CMD + OPT + I` on Mac, or `CTRL + SHIFT + I` on Windows to open the console!)

The web pages create [Chris Johnson](https://twitter.com/defaced) has taken advantage of a few neat little console tricks, namely the ability to add CSS to your own console commands. He's also very generously provided a [neat js library](https://defaced.dev/tools/consoleimg/) aptly named `consoleimg` that lets you add your very own.

Chris is no stranger to creativity in strange places... including creating a [game of pong](https://defaced.dev/web/chrome-devtools-pong/) that runs within the layers tool in the console as well!
