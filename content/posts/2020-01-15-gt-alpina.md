Swiss type foundry Grilli Type are at it again, GT Alpina. There really is no better way to describe it than the foundy's own words:

> GT Alpina by Reto Moser proudly calls itself a workhorse serif, but delights in playing with the very meaning of that concept. It reaches into the grab bag of typographic history to resurrect shapes some may mistakenly see as too expressive.

Now, for the extra icing on the cake, the font has been beautifully engineered as a beloved variable font!

And what better way to show off what a variable font can do, than a [full interactive exprience](http://gt-alpina.com/).

As you scroll through the site, you are presented with great type samples, in between the explainations of what makes the font special. Within each of these sampels, you can interact, touching from left to right and seeing the font change in front of your eyes.

The studio has a lot to show off here, including this fantastic hourglass font glyph, again animated with variable fonts.

Reto Moser, the primary designer really has outdone himself with this one. If you're feeling inspired, Reto has shared a collection of [favorite books](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/reto-moser-grilli-type-bookshelf-220317), that is definitely worth eyeballing.
