Well, January is almost over, and it's time for a recap from one of my favorite Twitter hashtags, [#PlotterTwitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=plottertwitter&src=typed_query).

For those unfamiliar with #PlotterTwitter, it's a place for people to show off their plotter art. With everyone able to see each other work and expand upon it, it has become an incredibly creative space.

And so we are here, a little recap of some of the best works in January's #PlotterTwitter!

Netpraxis has created some very nice patterns using [Moiré patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern). Which are complex patterns that emerge by overlaying two patterns on top of each other. They can look endlessly complex, and simple at the same time.

Julien Gachadoat has created some super clean, mechanical-esque plots. I haven't really seen anything like it.

Showing that you can find inspiration anywhere, Ruud de Rooij has plotted out every single way to cross a road 7 times without crossing over your path.

Tyler Hobbs has used a plotter to draw out a piece, and then hand pained the circles by hand.

Louis Hoebregts has recreated some Keith Haring works with a creative grid of swirls.

Yuin Chien has been plotting out 2d scaffolds from folded paper, in beautiful color markers, they truly pop out of the page.

Paul Rickards continues his amazing creativity with his work in shaded triangles, these crosshatches must really push the plotter to its limits.

ShornOne has been playing with [Stippling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stippling), creating patterns and images from small dots.

Luke Patton has been creating extremely elaborate patterns, starting simply on one edge of the paper and getting increasingly complex towards the other edge.

Rev Dan Catt's blue on black styles feels like they're putting more color onto the page than really possible.

And finally, Julien Espagnon's pieces show how beautiful randomly meandering paths can get.
