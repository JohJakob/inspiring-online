When I think of placeholder images, we will always think of the forever wonderful [placekitten](https://placekitten.com/) and [placepuppy](http://place-puppy.com/). This project though, adds a wonderful piece of randomness, art and joy that we've come to know and love from generative art.

[Generative placeholders](https://generative-placeholders.glitch.me/), has a wonderful artistic and nerdy flair and the added perk is that your placeholders will be extra unique!

The project offers a range of great generative and mathematical art and has gone above and beyond to add some wonderful color palettes, using provided by the lovely [nice color palettes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nice-color-palettes) node module.

**For example.**

![Generative Artwork 1](https://generative-placeholders.glitch.me/image?width=500&height=500&style=triangles&gap=50&colors=5&img=01)

and

![Generative Artwork 2](https://generative-placeholders.glitch.me/image?width=500&height=500&style=triangles&gap=50&colors=6&img=01)


If you're concerned that all your images will look the same, well fear not, there's an extra URL parameter (`img=X`) where X is the specific seed you would like to use.

Some of these placeholders come from my very own [generative artistry](https://generativeartistry.com/) so if you're interested in learning the process of developing them these tutorials will guide you through the process!

The project is also on glitch! So you can dig into all the code within the project, and remix it to your hearts desire.
