This year's leap year February has come and gone, and with it, 29 wonderful days of my favorite twitter hashtag, [#PlotterTwitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=plottertwitter&src=typed_query).

As with [January](https://inspiring.online/the-best-of-plottertwitter-from-january-2020./) here's another round-up of amazing artists & pen plottings, alongside any other commentary/algorithm I can spot within the works!

Straversi has printed off an elevation map of SF, in brilliant detail, created with this fantastic [open source tool](https://anvaka.github.io/peak-map/#7.68/47.727/-122.574) built on top of mapbox.

Joseph Wilk is doing some amazing work, hooking the axidraw up to something blowing air. With liquid inks, the outcome is intricate and super random.

Michelle Chandra is creating some spirographic patterns that mimicking that reminds me of the mystify screensaver on my old windows PC. The white ink on black paper is stunning.

Spongenuity is creating incredible multi-colored, multi-layered portraits using flow fields as a backing.

Neil Jenkins has been using [archimedian spirals](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArchimedeanSpiral.html) plots, with images behind them, creating intricate mesmerizing plots!

Rev Dan Catt has created a grid of vase patterns, with beautiful blue ink, the overlapping patterns really make them pop off the page.

Arjan van der Meij has plotted a series of hands, counting up in 10 bits. Super nerdy, and super unique.

Franz Jungreitmayr has created a digital bee, but is it hand-drawn, or done with a plotter?

Algorigraph's single line portraits are so clever, slowly interpolating between one design to the other.

Dan Anderson has been plotting designs onto shirts! I spy a [Lorenz Attractor!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system)

Julien Espagnon is combining flow fields with circle packing algorithms.

And that concludes my February wrap up. Once again #Plottertwitter proves to be an incredibly creative space, where the community continues to share their amazing work.
