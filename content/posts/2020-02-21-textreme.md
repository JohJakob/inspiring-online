Are you looking for the next big adventure within the wild world of text editors? Something a little more exciting than your day to day monospaced "every time you press a key the letter appears" life?

Well, here it is, TEXTREME, the next frontier in text editor functionality. And the recipe is perfect.

1. A pinch of pixelized 8-bit typography. With Unicode support.

2. A splash of particle explosions, one for every letter you type.

3. A swirling sensory explosion of thumps and thuds for every keypress, a laser zap for every new line.

4. For every character, you delete, send it flying off the editor like there's no tomorrow.

5. A super quirky rythm mode, see if you can type to the metronomic beat.

Textreme is available on Mac, Windows, and Linux, and is a delightful alternative if you're looking to mix it up in your day to day, or just something fun to play around with.

It's also open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/memetrooper/TEXTREME), built off the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), and is a great project if you're looking to dip your toes into open source game development. 

If you're looking for something a little more web-related, there's an amazing project by Kushagra Gour, called [Code Blast](https://kushagra.dev/lab/code-blast-codemirror/demo/index.html) adding particle effects to the popular web editor CodeMirror, also open source!
