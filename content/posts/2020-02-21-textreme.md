Are you looking for the next big adventure within the wild world of text editors? Something a little more exciting than your day-to-day, monospaced, "every time you press a key the letter appears" life?

Well, here it is: TEXTREME! The new frontier in text editor functionality. And the recipe is perfect...

1. A pinch of pixelized 8-bit typography. (With Unicode support.)

2. A splash of particle explosions, one for every letter you type.

3. A swirling sensory explosion of thumps and thuds for every keypress --- A laser zap for each new line.

4. For every character you delete, send it flying off the editor like there's no tomorrow.

5. To see if you can type to a metronomic beat, a super quirky rhythm mode.

Textreme is available on Mac, Windows, and Linux. It's a delightful alternative if you're looking to mix it up in your day-to-day, or just want something fun to play around with.

It's also open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/memetrooper/TEXTREME), built off the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), and is a great project if you're looking to dip your toes into open source game development.

If you're looking for something a little more web-related, there's an amazing project by Kushagra Gour called [Code Blast](https://kushagra.dev/lab/code-blast-codemirror/demo/index.html) for adding particle effects to the popular web editor CodeMirror, also open source!
