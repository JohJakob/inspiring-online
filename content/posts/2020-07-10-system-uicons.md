Australian Designer & Developer [Corey Ginnivan](https://corey.ginnivan.net/) has generously created and opened up a complete set of icons (220 to be exact) in his latest project, [System UIcons](https://systemuicons.com/)

When you're kicking off a new project, it's always important to have cohesion amongst your icons... the easiest way to do that of course is to pick a set and stick with it. Corey's project [System UIcons](https://systemuicons.com/) is a comprehensive and complete set that will cover all your basics, what's more, it's completely free, as in use it anywhere, attribute only if you want.

Corey, who's no stranger to icon sets, has another side project that I can't go without mentioning that follows the same conjoined wording naming scheme [Memeojis](https://www.memeoji.lol/)

The original System Uicons SVG's are available to download and remix if you feel, with a nifty and simple search tool to make the set easier to use. And then, the final icing on the cake, the whole project is [open sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/CoreyGinnivan/system-uicons) so you can follow along for more additions, and submit your own!
