This game hits me on one big and mighty level... I like a game to make me suffer. The special thing here is that it will shoot a deep pain into your human existence, one jump at a time.

The appropriately named [Leg Breaker](https://almbkn.itch.io/legbreaker) is a game for Mac, Linux and Windows... a platformer, like so many before it. The catch being, you can only jump twice.

When you jump, your leg breaks. When you jump again... well, your other leg breaks. At that point, you're left crawling upon the ground in a stumbling mess. Which you may actually want, depending on the puzzle.

If you're not the gaming type, you can watch some great playthroughs online, I've added one below just in case you're afraid to search for the extra look.

Now, for some extra nice chat about the game, if you're not convinced... one of the big difficulties in game development is propperly managing the scope of the project, keeping it fun, while keeping the gameplay challenging. Leg breaker does this wonderfully, keeping fully within its means, while keeping you coming back for more.

All art is of the handcrafted pixel variety, and the sounds, perfectly molded to send a chill of pain up down your spine on each and every jump you make.
