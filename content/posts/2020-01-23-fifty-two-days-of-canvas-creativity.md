[Canvas Cards](https://canvas-cards.glitch.me/) is an amazing year-long project by [Luke Patton](https://twitter.com/friendofpixels), featuring a weekly creation on the webs canvas element. Each of the cards has a different set of inspirations, looks, aims, and goals. And wow are they beautiful.

The website itself also allows you to edit the code and re-run the preview in the browser, meaning you can get to play with each and everyone without cloning the repository.

The combinations of colors and styles really keep the project amazingly interesting as it progressed throughout the year. 

For anyone who's tried to do something every week for an entire year, you know how difficult it can be, which really gives the project that extra special shine.

You may have also noticed that the project itself is hosted on Glitch! This means that you have full access to the source, and can fork and remix the cards as you please, which, for those interested in getting into generative art, is the perfect launching off point.

Luke has also written [about the process](https://friendofpixels.com/posts/making-canvas-cards) of his project, including some very interesting tidbits about offers for money, and selling the works. 

It's always something that can be difficult when you're building something for yourself. In this case, Luke opted for a license that would keep the source open, (
allowing people to print them if they wanted!) but stopping them from being sold. The Project was for fun! not for money!

Luke's open-ness, and honestly can be seen all through the project... anyone looking for an example of how to stick to your guns, whilst being true to your goals and ambitions, this is definitely the project for you.
