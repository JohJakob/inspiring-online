If you're looking for something unique as a gift, or for that personal flair, then look no further than [KnitYak](https://knityak.com/).

KnitYak started off as a [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fbz/knityak-custom-mathematical-knit-scarves), launched by [Fabienne "fbz" Serriere](http://fabienne.us/), with the goal of creating generative knitwear, and wow-oh-wow was it a success.

By basing all the designs off generative algorithms, KnitYak is able to make each item a one-off.

Looking through the catalog, you can recognize some of the generative algorithms that defined the art-space, from the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) to the [Cellular Automata](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CellularAutomaton.html). There's something very beautiful about pulling an algorithm out of the computer, and turning it into something you can physically touch and hold.

Each scarf is knitted on an industrial knitting machine, and my-oh-my is it a beast.

Giving the catalog a brief browse, it's very easy to see that these don't sit on the shelf long. In fact they look to be completely sold out as I write this!

Without a doubt, the best way to get your hands on one would be to follow the [KnitYak](https://twitter.com/knityak) Twitter account, look for release announcements, and jump on them the moment they're posted.

And as a final cool bonus, when your item arrives it includes the code that was used to generate it!

What a treat!
