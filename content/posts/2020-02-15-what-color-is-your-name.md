Synesthesia is a condition where certain senses overlap. For example, you could smell colors, or see sounds!

Bernadette Sheridan has a type of synesthesia whereby letters and numbers appear as colors within her brain (grapheme-color synesthesia). She has created a lovely map of those colors so we can experience it as well.

[What Color Is Your Name?](https://synesthesia.me) allows you to type in your name and see the colors that it produces. It's a wonderfully simple idea grounded in Bernadette's reality.

You may be surprised by what you find. For me, I'm a long combination of blues, with a yellow flair right at the end. You can play around with random names on the site, or browse the project's [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/SynesthesiaMe) and see everyone sharing their colors!

The project has done a fantastic job of raising awareness of the condition, and to boot, allows you [buy a beautiful](https://www.etsy.com/shop/SynesthesiaMe), clean print of whichever word you choose. Which can make for a wonderful and unique gift, as well as a perpetual talking point!

For those looking to dig into the topic more, Bernadette has written about it [extensively on Medium](https://medium.com/@bernadettes). You can really start to imagine what it is like seeing words as colors.

The Wikipedia article on [Synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia) is also a great jumping-off point... it's really amazing how little we actually know about our brains.
