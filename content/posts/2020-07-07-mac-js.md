That's right, we've officially gone too far, developer [Felix Rieseberg](https://github.com/felixrieseberg) has ported Mac OS8 (with some help) into an [Electron App](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/macintosh.js) that you can download and run on your Mac, or PC.

The JavaScript OS implementation is amazingly complete, running a plethora of the old apps and games that you undoubtedly remember from back in the day, many of them pre-installed!

> You'll find various games and demos preinstalled, thanks to an old MacWorld Demo CD from 1997. Namely, Oregon Trail, Duke Nukem 3D, Civilization II, Alley 19 Bowling, Damage Incorporated, and Dungeons & Dragons.

If these games aren't enough for you, you can jump through a couple of hoops and install your own. Honestly, I've found that this runs profoundly well, and is well worth checking out, or just noodling around with on a long flight.

If you're interested in digging into the emulation side of things, Macintosh.js is running off [Basilisk II](http://basilisk.cebix.net/), an open-source Mac Simulator, which honestly, looking at the code makes very little sense to me, it's honestly an engineering marvel from my perspective!
