If you're setting up your brand new laptop and looking for a new terminal and IDE font, then [MonoLisa](https://www.monolisa.dev/) could be the breath of fresh air that you're looking for!

<!--more-->

Built by font foundry [FaceType](https://www.facetype.org/) MonoLisa was specifically build to help you over those long haul sessions, in their own words:

> MonoLisa was designed by professionals to improve developers’ productivity and reduce fatigue.

By providing a slightly wider monospace, and some specifically curated characters MonoLisa allows your eyes to glide over your code with ease and comfort. With a few extra ligatures thrown into the mix, it really feels like the font you've been looking for!

Managed like a software project rather than a static entity, you can see [the smaller version updates](https://www.monolisa.dev/releases) as they roll through making the font nicer and nicer with each iteration.

[The site](https://www.monolisa.dev/) also provides you with a great playground (honestly a mandatory these days for new fonts) to compare how it will look in your favorite language
