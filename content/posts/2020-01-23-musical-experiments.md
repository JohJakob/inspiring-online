Its throwback Thursday,and this project is still just as beautiful and fun as it is the day it came into the world!

Berlin Based developer, [Martin Wecke](https://martinwecke.de/) has created a fantastic minimal set of [browser based instruments](https://martinwecke.de/%F0%9F%8E%B5/) that are both aesthetically beautiful, and simple to use!

There are three experiments in all, the first, a cycling beat machine, that you can play with your keyboard (and that will make sure your beats are in time, for the musically challenged).

The second, a triangular arpeggiator, allowing you to warm and change the sounds in 2d space.

And thirdly, what could best be described as a wobble machine, which gets more and more addictive the more you play it.

Martin really spends a solid amount of time making all of his projects a visual delight.

On the front end, all these instruments look to be made the same, a canvas layer providing some elegant interactions (especially on mobile).

On the back end, they're a little different. The beat machine is using samples, that are played on the beats as the loop cycles over and over itself.

The arpeggiator and wobble machine are both using [Tone.JS](https://tonejs.github.io/) to create the sounds you're heading on the fly straight from the browser!
