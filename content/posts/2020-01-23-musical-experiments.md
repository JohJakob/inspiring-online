It's Throwback Thursday, and this project is still just as beautiful and fun as it was the day it came into the world!

Berlin-based developer [Martin Wecke](https://martinwecke.de/) has created a fantastic minimal set of [browser based instruments](https://martinwecke.de/%F0%9F%8E%B5/) that are both aesthetically beautiful, and simple to use!

**There are three experiments in all:**
The first, a cycling beat machine that you can play with your keyboard (and for the musically challenged, it will make sure your beats are in time).

The second, a triangular arpeggiator, allows you to warm and change the sounds in 2d space.

And thirdly, what could best be described as a wobble machine, which gets more and more addictive the more you play it.

Martin really spends a solid amount of time making all of his projects a visual delight.

On the front end, all these instruments look to be made the same---a canvas layer providing some elegant interactions (especially on mobile).

On the back end, they're a little different. The beat machine uses samples that are played on the beats as the loop cycles over and over itself.

The arpeggiator and wobble machine both use [Tone.JS](https://tonejs.github.io/) to create sounds on the fly straight in the browser!
