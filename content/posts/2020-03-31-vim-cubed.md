Has anyone ever stopped you on the street to show you their vim setup? Well, now you have the perfect reply with [vim cubed](https://github.com/oakes/vim_cubed).

Vim Cubed will bring your code editing into the 3rd dimension, literally in the form of a spinning cube. As the cube spins infinitely, your editor works with all the gusto and power that vim can provide.

As per the project's QA, the most important information is all there.

Vim cubed is built in [NIM](https://nim-lang.org/features.html) which is a language that compiles down to `C`, creating small, dependency-free executables. The vim cubed source is short and concise, and a great example of what NIM can do.
