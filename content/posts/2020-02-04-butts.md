I've always been a fan of the weirder side projects out there. 

They take you out of your comfort zone, out of your work zone and into a special place where you can explore everything and anything to the edge of the world. 

One morning, [Pablo Stanley](https://www.pablostanley.com/) woke up and decided to embark on a side-project adventure, and that adventure was the creation of [buttsss.com](https://www.buttsss.com/).

In Pablo's own words:

> I doubted myself at every step, with a voice in my head telling me, “Butts? Pablo, this is terrible. Stop!” 

[Buttsss](https://www.buttsss.com/) is not only a creative outlet but also the world's fullest and complete collection of illustrated butts. From the Triple Butt and Space Butt all the way to the UX Butt and the Business Butt, they're all accounted for

What butt directory wouldn't be complete without a release video, including a catchy tune that will sing in your head for days.

One of the most amazing things here is that all these butts are generously available today, for free! For both business and personal use. 

The true beauty, and the icing on the cake for me, is the elaborate [case study](https://modus.medium.com/buttsss-case-study-a8d35f604c1b) that follows. A true deep dive into the project, entailing the hours and human effort that goes into a project like this.
