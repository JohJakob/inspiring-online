Since variable fonts have been introduced to the web, we've been seeing more and more creativity and beauty. Marvin Visions is one of the trailblazer fonts that carved out the space! Popping up in 2017.

> Marvin Visions is a modern and consistent reinterpretation of Marvin, a typeface originally designed by Michael Chave in 1969 and published by Face Photosetting. It has been revived and expanded by Mathieu Triay for the identity of [Visions](https://www.readvisions.com/), a new science fiction magazine.
