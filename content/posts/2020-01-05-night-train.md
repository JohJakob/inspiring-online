When it comes to fitting amazing creations into the smallest amount of code possible, I don't think there are any better [Mathieu 'p01' Henri](http://www.p01.org/), and this sketch, Night Train, is no exception.

The scene, featuring a train rolling on through a generative field, complete with grass and some windy tree's is really a mind blower, especially considering it consists of 242 characters (fitting in a tweet!)

For real though, what is that emoji doing in there?

Of course, there's a little more running behind the scenes, the demo is built to run on the [PICO8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a tiny "fantasy console" built to mimic a real console, without any of the hardware. 

Honestly, the console looks great for those looking to get into creative coding, but want to limit their scope to the beautiful and quirky old school looks. You can dig into getting started with the PICO8 world [here](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=faq)

Following the hashtags on the tweet, there's a whole lot of [amazing PICO8 developers](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tweetjam) out there creating some really neat stuff. Definitely check it out if you're looking for some inspiration.

I was lucky enough to see Mathieu present at Front Trends in 2017, where he talked about some of his amazing demo's, as well as tiny javascript (something I like to cover on this blog a lot, under the tag microcode). It was both educational, and really really impressive.

If you've got a spare 30 minutes, I really recommend checking it out!
