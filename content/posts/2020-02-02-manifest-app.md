Note-taking is as old as time, over there years there have always been new takes at what works... and since everyone is different each has their own audience!

[Manifest.App](https://www.manifest.app/) is a great grid based, sticky-note-esque note-taking app, (built by [Jonathon Toon](https://jonathontoon.com/)) that sits nicely in your browser.

Manifest utilized a neat grid structure, ensuring your notes site nice and pleasingly on the page. You can click and add as many as you like, meaning it will bend nicely to your will on both big screens and smaller.

In an effort to keep things as simple as possible, features are scarce (in a good way) ... This will keep your notes short and precise, without the need to overflow the page.

Manifest.App supports dark mode straight off the cuff, utilizing your user settings, naturally. There's no need to complicate the user interface or code.

On the topic of the code, which is generously [open source](https://github.com/jonathontoon/manifest), there are no complicated frameworks... just clean and beautiful vanilla javascript. Well worth prying into if you're looking to learn!

And as a nice final touch, again very on point with the minimalism on display, the storage is local on your machine. No overcomplicated logins and accounts.
