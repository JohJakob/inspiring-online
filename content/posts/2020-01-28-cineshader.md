If you've ever looked into shaders, then you've run into [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/), a fantastic tool and community to build shaders in the browser, as well as show off what you've made... that said, shaderToy's aesthetic and appeal is directly targeted to developers who are there for the shader and its code.

[CineShader](https://cineshader.com/), is a layer on top of Shader toy. A website built to show off your shader to a broader audience, in way that shows off not just the art, but also shows the beauty and feel of the shader, as though it was artwork on a wall.

By creating a 3D scene, along with a dark shaded audience member, CineShader creates the tone and feel of being in a gallery, silently observing and enjoying a piece of work

And that's not all! CineShader provides a beautiful editor, with an editing structure that matches ShaderToy, meaning your code will conveniently work great in both sites!

In fact, CineShader isn't saving any of your shaders, they're providing a few "save slots" with local storage, and providing a very simple system for you to save them on shaderToy, and simply extend the viewing experience.

As extra sweet icing on the cake, there is a plan to support VR in the future, which will really be an exciting way to show off your code!
