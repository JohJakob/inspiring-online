[Falling sand games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling-sand_game) have been around for a long time (as early as 2005, according to the Wikipedia), they provide a canvas for artful exploration, creativity, and just all-round relaxing fun.

[SandSpiel](https://sandspiel.club/) by [Max Bittker](https://maxbittker.com/) is no exception, a fantastic sand simulation combining a lot of great elements from the originals, from the base sand and water, through to lava, wood, fungus, and ice.

The aim of the game is to create, pouring water and seeds onto the ground will result in plants and flowers blooming. Drop some lava onto it, and it all goes up into smoke. 

People are really getting creative with this... its well worth dropping in to the [gallery](https://sandspiel.club/browse/) and browsing the creations!

Now, I'm a little late writing about this (it was released in late 2018), but it was too fun not to share. Max has also [written up](https://maxbittker.github.io/making-sandspiel) a great "making of" article, digging into the inspirations, aspirations and more.

All round, it's always great to see someone creating purely for fun and joy. Sharing their story, their inspirations, and their goals! And on top of that, putting it all out there on [GitHub!](https://github.com/MaxBittker/sandspiel)
