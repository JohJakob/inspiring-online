This week saw [#PortfolioDay](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PortfolioDay) shoot up on Twitter, filling my feed with a marvelous array of talent.

It felt fitting to share a few of my favorite new follows, all people who will provide your Twitter feed with a fresh boost of color and a delightful pop of positivity.

Australian Artist [Milly Que](https://www.millyque.com/)'s illustrations are just a stunning breath of fresh air.

[Cassandra Jean](http://cassandrajeanart.blogspot.com/)'s color palettes give such mysterious energy to each and every artwork. It's like you can feel them coming to life.

[Rob Fichman](https://robfichman.com/about)'s animations are some of the most delightfully satisfying gifs out there. He's also studying video game development!

[Eddie H.Hinestroza](https://eddiehernandez9655.artstation.com/)'s environment scenes really pull you in. There's so much detail and life in every square inch, they just pull you away to another place.

Really, there are so so so many more amazing folio's out there, I really recommend checking out the hashtag ([#PortfolioDay](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PortfolioDay)) and crawling through them. Find a few new artists, and watch as they grow and evolve their work over the coming years!
