This is a true gem in the realm of what I'm tagging in Inspiring.Online as [microcode](https://inspiring.online/tag/microcode/). [bbcmicrobot](https://twitter.com/bbcmicrobot) is am amazing tweet-bot, if you @ it some BASIC code, it will reply with an animated rendering of the result.

This project is fairly fresh, but already yielding fantastic results. I many ways can show us all how such a small amount of code can result in something so beautiful and animated.

For the tweets below, you can see both the code and the outcome. I've tried to identify and link out to the theory or idea behind the code if I can spot it easily.

With all creative code... playing around with it is an incredible opportunity to learn while explore your own creative side! Remix, resend and create something new! If you've got something you're proud of, [edit this post in GitHub](https://github.com/tholman/inspiring-online/blob/master/content/posts/2020-02-15-eight-bit-code.md) to share it!

Here, we have [Sierpiński's Triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle). Its amazing how much complexity can be pulled from recursive code!

An instance of the beloved `10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10`... a beautiful [staple](https://10print.org/) in the world of generative code. The randomization of two characters shows so much complexity and beauty!

Random triangle generation, colors, and fills. Really such simple code, that sucks you into the screen.

Its projects like this that really show how powerful visual code can be!

It's a starfield. I can see the random numbers, but how it's looping and animating is beyond me. Beautiful!

A beautiful trigonometric cycle, creative some [Moiré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern) styled patterns... not quite the same thing. I'm guessing the visual complexity is coming from the pixel aliasing?

This has to be the [Dragon Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve)

{{< twitter 1227301710407831557 >}}

Really, the whole account is worth the follow. I can tell right now, we're just watching the tipping point of what will be a marvelous collection of beautiful code!
