A lot of generative artists show off their creations, with some clever curation tools allowing you to make small adjustments. This project is a great twist on that idea.

[TinkerSynth](https://tinkersynth.com/) is a generative art machine, in the literal sense, modeled after a synth. With the artwork on the left, and a set of special tools on the right.

Tinkersynth encourages you to interact with it to discover how each of the tools works, just as though you are learning how to use something for the very first time... each icon means something different, and you'll need to play with each and everyone before you feel comfortable leaving the page.

In the creator, [Joshua Comeau's](https://github.com/joshwcomeau) own words:

> Tinkersynth prioritizes being delighted by unexpected effects rather than creating an intuitive, predictable tool.

If the joy of creating the artwork isn't enough, Tinkersynth is full of secrets and easter eggs that will keep you exploring. Each of the small tools is a delight to use, obeying the law that every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

Tinkersynth allows you to export your creations in multiple formats! Opaque and transparent PNG, and the beloved SVG, meaning you'll be able to plug them into your pen plotter and turn them into physical pieces.

The project is also open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/tinkersynth). It's a really complicated project with many small moving pieces and utilized react & redux to manage the complex state machine. If you're looking to learn, this is a great project to pull apart.
