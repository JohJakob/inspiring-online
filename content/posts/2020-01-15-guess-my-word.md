I love a game with a simple premise, and [Guess my Word](https://hryanjones.com/guess-my-word/) doesn't get any simpler.

Every day comes with a new word, and the rules are simple. You are trying to guess the word (a surprise, I know). When you guess a word you will be told whether it is alphabetically above or below the goal word.

The real fun is when you start narrowing in on the word, and suddenly you're pressing your brain to find out what other words could possibly be between *aardvark* and *aargh*.

Don't worry though, you'll get it in the end. It's actually kind of amazing how your brain begins to eek out words that you haven't thought of in years.

With a new word each day, the game will really have you coming back in the after hours of the work day when you've got 10 minutes to burn.

As an added bonus, there's a [leaderboard](https://hryanjones.com/guess-my-word/board.html) which keeps track of the hunters throughout each day. Honestly, some of the scores are hard to believe, but I guess you can't be #1 without a little luck.

The developer, [H. Ryan Jones](https://hryanjones.com/) has also generously put the source code up on [GitHub](https://github.com/hryanjones/guess-my-word) acknowledging that it is based on a (now defunct) game of the same name.
