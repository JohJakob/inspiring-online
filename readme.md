## Inspiring Online
[An online blog about inspiring work](https://inspiring.online), both online and off. Built and managed by [Tim Holman](http://tholman.com)

I aim to hype up neat and new creations on the web, interesting code and design, art, typography, and really just all things that catch my eye. Providing a resource that can be both inspiring, and educational.

The blog itself is open source (which you can tell, reading this readme)... I'm aiming to make it easy for people to contribute, from fixing spelling mistakes, to making their own posts. 

### Edits

At the bottom of each post link is the option to edit! If you have anything to add to a post, or any typo's etc, fix them up and I'll add them in!

### Proposals

If you have any hot links, open them up in a GitHub issue! If they're nice and recent, and fit the content, I'll write about them... of course, you could do that yourself if you feel so inclined! 

Ideally new items fit the current topics written about (code, art, design, type, games etc)
